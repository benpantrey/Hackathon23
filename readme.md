# Hackathon 2023

Our team name is Slackers.

Our project's goal was to create a Slack Channel that will be automatically populated every week with Google Analytics insights about the [Documentation website](docs.sysdig.com).

The metrics we have prioritised are the following:


1. Page Views
2. Top Pages
3. Average Time on Page
4. Bounce Rate
5. New Visitor Sessions
6. Returning Visitor Sessions
7. Exit Rate
8. Top Exit Pages


Some other metrics I think would be useful:
- Top landing pages
- Top sources for new users
- How many 'Yes' or 'No' responses each page gets for 'Was this page helpful?'
- Most common search queries

 We looked at an existing Slack app, [Google Analytics Insights](https://sysdigcloud.slack.com/apps/AA42VQN5U-google-analytics-insights). This app has free features, as well as a paid plan. The free version is limited, and the paid plan is prohibitively expensive, at $2148 per annum.

 We chose to create our own app, that would include the paid features offered in Google Analytics Insights.

 Google Analytics provides information, but not all information is equaly useful. There is no sense in bombarding the Docs team with information that doesn't help or guide their efforts. An example might be site traffic. The Docs team is not running a marketing campaign, so it doesn't make sense to tell them how many people are coming to the site.
 
 Furthermore, there is no sense to receiving weekly reports if the information does not change week by week. Some stats are basically fixed, for example, the most visited pages, so there is no point sending it repeatedly.
