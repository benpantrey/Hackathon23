# Hackathon 2023

Our team name is Slackers.

Our project's goal was to create a Slack Channel that will be automatically populated every week with Google Analytics insights about the [Documentation website](docs.sysdig.com).

The metrics we have prioritised are the following:


1. Page Views
2. Top Pages
3. Average Time on Page
4. Bounce Rate
5. New Visitor Sessions
6. Returning Visitor Sessions
7. Exit Rate
8. Top Exit Pages


Some other metrics I think would be useful:
Top landing pages
Top sources for new users
How many clicks 'Yes' and 'No' get for the 'Was this page helpful?' question at the bottom of each page.
Most common search queries.
